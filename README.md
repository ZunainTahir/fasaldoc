## 📌 Executive Summary

**FasalDoc** is an AgriTech startup platform built to bridge the critical veterinary and agricultural extension gap in South Asia. Smallholder farmers face up to **35-40% annual crop loss and severe livestock mortality** due to delayed diagnosis, remote farmland locations, and lack of affordable agronomic expertise.

FasalDoc provides an **instant, bilingual (Urdu & English), multi-modal AI companion** that runs right from the farmer's smartphone camera — diagnosing plant pathologies and animal diseases in real-time, delivering certified chemical + organic remedies with exact dosages and local Pakistani brand recommendations, fully operable **online or completely offline**.

## ⚡ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Node.js `>= 18.0.0`
- npm or pnpm

### 1. Clone & Setup Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

*(Optional)* Add your free API keys to `backend/.env`:
```env
PORT=8000
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_groq_api_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy_your_gemini_key_here
```

Start the backend:
```bash
npm start
# 🚀 Backend listening on http://localhost:8000
```

### 2. Setup & Run Frontend

In the root directory:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# 🌐 Live App accessible at http://localhost:5173
```

> **💡 Fast Demo Tip**: On the login screen, click **"Continue as Demo Farmer (چوہدری طارق)"** to explore all AI diagnosis, RAG chatbot, and tools features instantly with pre-seeded data.

---

## 🔒 Security & Data Privacy

- **Zero Client-Side API Keys**: All LLM and AI keys are securely held on the Node.js backend.
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: User scans, diagnoses, and personal farm data in Supabase are isolated strictly per authenticated user ID.
- **Client-Side Compression**: Photos are downscaled before transmission to protect bandwidth and reduce cloud computing latency.

---

## 🔌 API Endpoints

The backend exposes a minimal REST API for AI-powered diagnosis and chat:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/health` | Health check with active LLM provider status |
| `POST` | `/api/diagnose` | Image-based crop/livestock disease diagnosis (accepts base64 JPEG) |
| `POST` | `/api/chat` | Bilingual AI agricultural chat with RAG context |

> See [docs/API_REFERENCE.md](docs/API_REFERENCE.md) for full request/response schemas, error codes, and example payloads.

---

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch

# TypeScript type-check
npm run type-check
```

The test suite uses **Vitest** with **48 unit tests** covering weather risk scoring, mandi price trends, government schemes filtering, yield estimation, seed rate calculations, and community pest reports.

---

## ⚙️ Environment Configuration

FasalDoc uses a strict **separation of secret vs public config**:

| File | Scope | Contains |
|------|-------|----------|
| `.env` (root) | Frontend (public) | `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `VITE_API_URL` |
| `backend/.env` | Backend (secret) | LLM API keys, server port, CORS origins |

> API keys **never** touch the client bundle. See `.env.example` in each directory for the full template.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

### Frontend (Vercel / Netlify)
```bash
npm run build
# Output: dist/ — deploy to any static host
```

### Backend (Node.js host)
```bash
cd backend
npm start
# Binds to PORT (default 8000)
```

### Docker (Startup ML Reference)
```bash
cd Startup/fasaldoc-project/fasaldoc/backend
docker-compose up --build
```
